# ♻️ SmartRecycle – Circular Economic Waste Management Platform

A cloud-native platform to track, classify, and incentivize waste disposal using AI, IoT, and gamification — developed for Infosys Global Hackathon 2025.

---

## 🚀 Problem Statement

Most urban waste goes unsegregated and unrecycled due to a lack of real-time visibility, incentives for citizens, and coordinated recycling workflows. This breaks the circular economy and leads to unnecessary landfill overflow.

---

## 💡 Solution Overview

SmartRecycle creates a digital loop between:
- 🧍 Citizens (waste generators)
- 🚛 Collectors
- 🏭 Recyclers
- 🧑‍🏫 NGOs / Government bodies

Citizens scan QR-tagged smart bins to dispose of waste. AI classifies it and rewards points for correct segregation. Recyclers receive real-time data on what’s been collected, closing the circular loop.
